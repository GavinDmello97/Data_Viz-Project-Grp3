##RULES TO PUSH CODE:

1) For every small feature, create a new branch using the command ```git checkout -b branch-name``` from a stable working code.
2) Push your code only on the branch you are currently working on.
3) Once the entire feature is complete and tested(free of bugs), **raise a PR** to merge your working branch into the Develop branch of the respective Ends(frontend pr backend)
4) Someone will approve your code and merge it into develop. 

## **Once we have a complete project of Phase 1 completed, we will merge the develop branch into **master**
